JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

JWTs are typically used in authentication and information exchange systems. They can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Here's a brief overview of how JWTs are structured:

Header: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. It's Base64Url encoded.

Payload: The payload, also Base64Url encoded, contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data.

Signature: To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

These three parts are separated by dots (.) and together make a JWT token. For example, a JWT token might look like this:

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

JWTs are widely used for stateless authentication mechanisms for APIs. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.

Here's a basic example of how JWTs might be used in a workflow:

A client sends a request to authenticate with the server, providing their credentials.
Upon successful authentication, the server creates a JWT token and sends it back to the client.
In all future requests to the server, the client includes this token in the header of the HTTP request (usually in the 'Authorization' field with 'Bearer' schema).
The server then verifies the JWT token and if valid, processes the request.
Remember that the payload of a JWT is just Base64Url encoded, which can be easily decoded, so it's important not to include sensitive data in the payload
